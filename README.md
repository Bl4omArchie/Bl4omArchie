<h3 align="center">Hey, I'm archie, this is my presentation</h3>

I'm a second year student in Computing Science. I've made a lot of repository, the most interesting ones are the most active or are pinned. The other, maybe I will finished them later :)
This is a summary of what I'm doing:
- High level language: Python and Low level: C, C++
- Exploring GPU computing with CUDA (parallelization, HPC, IA ...)
- Learning High Performance Computing and every techniques that make a program go faster
- Number Theory and primes numbers
- Handling a community around cryptography, cybersecurity and coding
