I'm a second year student in Computing Science passionate about algorithm implementation and cryptographic algorithm more specifically. My personal goal is to train my coding skills to produce high quality code, get ideas for new project that I can develop in personal project (or maybe more) and help people by creating and spreading articles and documentation.

- Developing in high level language: Python and also low level: C/C++
- Exploring GPU computing with CUDA (parallelization, HPC, IA ...)
- Learning High Performance Computing algorithm and method 
- Interest in Number Theory and primes numbers
- Manage a community around cryptography, cybersecurity and coding
