<h3 align="center">Hey, I'm archie, this is my presentation</h3>

I'm a third year student in Computing Science. I've made a lot of repository, the most interesting ones are the most active or are pinned. The other, maybe I may finish them later :)
This is a summary of what I'm currently doing:
- Cybersecurity development
- Application development
- Data Visualization 

If you want to contact me, please do. There is my discord: discord.gg/kK3kdFZ
