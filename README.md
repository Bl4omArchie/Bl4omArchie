<h3 align="center">Hey, I'm archie, this is my presentation</h3>

I'm a second year student in Computing Science. I've made a lot of repository, the most interesting ones are the most active or are pinned. The other, maybe I will finished them later :)
This is a summary of what I'm doing:
- High level language: Python, Low level: C, C++ and I'm also having view on Go and Rust
- Exploring GPU computing with CUDA and HPC (I like when it goes fast)
- Doing a lot of cryptography, my goal is to make the most secure and qualitatif code for security purpose
- Handling a community around cryptography, cybersecurity and coding

I'm really enjoying what I'm doing and the only thing I want for christmas is to learn more security and coding stuff.
