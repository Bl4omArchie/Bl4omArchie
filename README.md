<h3 align="center">Hey, I'm archie, this is my presentation</h3>

I'm a second year student in Computing Science. I've made a lot of repository, the most interesting ones are the most active or are pinned. The other, maybe I will finished them later :)
This is a summary of what I'm currently doing:
- A lot of cryptography: I'm implementing cryptosystem like RSA, PRNG like Fortuna and more
- Exploring GPU computing with CUDA and HPC (I like when it goes fast)
- Competitive algorithms: data structure, parallelization and Multi-Precision-Arithmetic
- Handling a community about cryptography, cybersecurity and coding

If you want to contact me, please do. There is my discord: discord.gg/kK3kdFZ
